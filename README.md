#### Task 1 - Implement Caesar Cipher

**Explanation**: 

ðŸ”’ **Encrypt and Decrypt Messages with Caesar Cipher in Python!** ðŸ”‘

Ever wanted to encode your messages for fun or to keep them private? Look no further! With just a few lines of Python code, you can encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar cipher. Simply input your message, choose a shift value, and select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt.

**Execution**:

1. **Encrypt a Message**
   1. Choose option e from the menu.
   2. Enter the message you want to encrypt.
   3. Enter the shift value (an integer representing how many positions each letter in the message should be shifted).
   4. The program will output the encrypted message.
   5. Decrypt a Message
6. choose option d from the menu.
8)Enter the message you want to decrypt.
9)Enter the shift value (the same value used to encrypt the message).
